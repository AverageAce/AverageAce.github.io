                Welcome! I’m <b>Casey Arterburn</b>, and I’m glad you’re here.
                My career has been anything but ordinary—driven by an insatiable curiosity and a knack for reinventing myself.
                It all began with a dream of creating AAA video games, which I pursued relentlessly, even when resources were scarce.
                After earning a BFA in Interactive Design and Game Development from SCAD in 2015, I worked on titles like <i>In the Black</i> and groundbreaking projects such as the THAAD Skills Trainer, blending my passion for immersive visuals with innovative problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-blurb">
                In 2019, inspired by my family’s military service, I enlisted in the Alabama Army National Guard as an IT Specialist.
                This pivot sparked a love for computers, cybersecurity, and the intricate dance of technology.
                My journey has since taken me from 3D artistry to IT leadership and into cybersecurity, where I thrive on tackling challenges and safeguarding systems.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-blurb">
                When I’m not immersed in work, you’ll find me chasing down new hobbies, practicing guitar, learning French, diving into computer science, or losing myself in a great book.
                Whether it’s mastering code, chords, or conjugations, I’m always up for the next adventure.
